.SH "about"
the original idea for this came from my friend charlie \fI\fR who initially provided me with a simple git alias that would do the same, but it only worked for repos that were https and was not platform independent\. I was also inspired by the git\-up \fI\fR ruby gem in how seamlessly it integrated with git\. Here is the original git alias (made to work on osx), which charlie wrote (plop it in your \.gitconfig, if you don\'t want to install a ruby gem to open your git remotes):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

[alias]
    open\-remote = "!open $(git remote \-v $@ | grep \-o \'http\e\eS*\' | head \-1); :"
